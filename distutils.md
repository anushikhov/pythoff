The distutils package provides support for building and installing additional modules into a Python installation. 

The new modules may be either pure Python, or extension modules written in C or a mix.

numpy.distutils is part of NumPy, and extends the standard Python distutils module to deal with Fortran sources and F2PY signature files, e.g. compile Fortran sources, call F2PY to construct extension modules, etc.
